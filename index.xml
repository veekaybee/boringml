build.scala is the more advanced version of the build.sbt file, and often is used for more complicated projects.
Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of the difference between .sbt and .scala build files:

Both look at an array and determine if it has a specific key, but their behavior is different.
isset will return false if the value of that key is null. array_key_exists will only look at the key itself.
Using an id as an example:
$a = array(&amp;#39;1&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;`12345678`&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;key2&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; null); isset($a[&amp;#39;key1&amp;#39;]); //true isset($a[&amp;#39;key2&amp;#39;]); //false array_key_exists(&amp;#39;key1&amp;#39;, $a); // true array_key_exists(&amp;#39;key2&amp;#39;, $a); //true So if you want your function to be null-safe, isset is always the best best.</description></item><item><title>is_set</title><link>http://boringml.com/docs/languages/php/arrays/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://boringml.com/docs/languages/php/arrays/</guid><description>Is set versus array_key_exists # I dug into the performance of isset versus array_key_exists in PHP.

If you can&amp;rsquo;t read what you wrote, you can&amp;rsquo;t change what you wrote. There are lots of organizations, especially once you get to larger companies where programming isn&amp;rsquo;t the core competency or value center, that are prime examples of this. The result is a mess that not only impacts the code, but the entire company or business.</description></item><item><title>strptime and strftime</title><link>http://boringml.com/docs/languages/python/strptime/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://boringml.com/docs/languages/python/strptime/</guid><description>One weird trick about Python date formats # I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with date manipulation in Python as part of this Reddit challenge, which asks the programmer to find the year(s) in history when the most US presidents were alive given each president&amp;rsquo;s birth and death date.
Usually, when working with dates and times in programming, it&amp;rsquo;s best to convert to object types that inherently have some assumptions about time and date already built in to allow for easy addition, subtraction, and date conversion.</description></item><item><title>venv</title><link>http://boringml.com/docs/languages/python/venv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://boringml.com/docs/languages/python/venv/</guid><description> Creating a new venv # source

Motivating the Chapter
We cover the first part of this chapter, which deals with Jaccard similarity, shingling, and minhash.
Often these days data analysis involves datasets that have high dimensionality, meaning the data set in question has more features than values and to make statistically sound inferences at scale, require large amounts of data (more info here, on p. 22), and itâ€™s these kinds of datasets that Chapter 3 deals with.</description></item><item><title>What is machine learning engineering?</title><link>http://boringml.com/docs/what-is-ml/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://boringml.com/docs/what-is-ml/</guid><description>What is machine learning engineering? # Once, on a crisp cloudless morning in early fall, a machine learning engineer left her home to seek the answers that she could not find, even in the newly-optimized Google results.
She closed her laptop, put on her backpack and hiking boots, and walked quietly out her door and past her mailbox, down a dusty path that led past a stream, until the houses around her gave way to broad fields full of ripening corn.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>http://boringml.com/docs/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://boringml.com/docs/about/</guid><description>About Me # Hi!

Precision and recall are common ways to evaluate the accuracy of your machine learning or information retrieval model. In other contexts, such as statistics, the measurements around these terms is also known as Type I/Type II errors.
Letâ€™s say youâ€™re working on understanding the relevancy of SnakeSearch, a search engine that looks to find relevant Python documentation for you. Letâ€™s say you want to find documents related to Pandas, as youâ€™re getting started with Pandas, the Python software library, and want some information.</description></item><item><title>Sample data in PySpark</title><link>http://boringml.com/docs/platforms/spark/create-data-python/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://boringml.com/docs/platforms/spark/create-data-python/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s how to create a small fake dataset for testing in PySpark.
