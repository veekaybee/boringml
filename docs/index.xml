I&amp;rsquo;m Vicki. I&amp;rsquo;m a machine learning engineer at Duo working on ML platforms with deep expertise in YAML indentation. I live in Philly with my family. In my free time, I love to write about Life. I also like to think about what technology means in the context of society, and write about that, as well. My main site is here.
I also love tweeting terrible puns and doodling tech logos.</description></item></channel></rss>
