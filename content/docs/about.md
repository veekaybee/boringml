Hi! I'm Vicki. I'm a machine learning engineer at Duo working on ML platforms with deep expertise in YAML indentation.  I live in Philly with my family. In my free time, I love to write about Life. I also like to think about [what technology means](https://vicki.substack.com/) in the context of society, and write about that, as well. My main site is [here.](https://vickiboykis.com) 

I also love tweeting terrible puns and doodling tech logos.
